# Clothing Retailer Customer Analysis

## **Business Context**
A clothing business wants to understand how it can increase its sales and frequency of customer purchases. The stakeholders suspect that there are many factors, such as the demographics of their customers, the type of shipping services and payment methods, that influence buying behaviors, however they have no clear insight into how it affects the sales performance and repeat purchase rates.

## **Problem Statement**
The goal of this analysis is to identify the key factors that affect the sales performance and repeat customer purchases for the clothing business. By analyzing customer demographics, product category preferences and transaction behaviors (shipping and payment methods), we aim to provide actionable insight that can help increase the average purchase amount and boost purchase frequency per customer.

### **Key questions to answer**
- What demographics segment and product categories strongly influence repeat purchases?
- How do shipping and payment methods impact average purchase amount value and purchase frequency?
- What strategies can the business implement to increase revenue and strengthen customer retention?
